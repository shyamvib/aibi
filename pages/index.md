# Executive Guide to RSM Performance Analysis

Welcome to the RSM Performance Dashboard. This guide will help you interpret the data and derive actionable insights from the RSM detail pages.

## Dashboard Navigation

- [RSM Dashboard](/rsm_dashboard) - Overview of all RSMs with key metrics and comparisons
- [RSM Detail](/rsm_detail) - In-depth analysis of individual RSM performance

## How to Interpret the RSM Detail Page

The RSM Detail page provides comprehensive insights into an individual RSM's performance across different customer segments and engagement activities. Here's how to interpret the key metrics and correlations:

### Overview Tab

#### Revenue and Customer Metrics

- **Total Revenue & Customers**: Baseline performance metrics for the RSM
- **Revenue Breakdown**: Shows how revenue is distributed across customer segments
  - High percentage in "Existing Customers" indicates focus on account maintenance
  - High percentage in "Repeat Customers" suggests strong retention strategies
  - High percentage in "One-Time Customers" may indicate acquisition focus but retention challenges

#### Engagement-Revenue Correlation

This section shows the statistical relationship between customer engagement (calls/meetings) and revenue generation:

- **Green Values (Positive Correlation)**: More calls/meetings correlate with higher revenue
- **Gray Values (No Clear Correlation)**: Calls/meetings don't show a clear impact on revenue
- **Red Values (Negative Correlation)**: More calls/meetings correlate with lower revenue

### Insight Patterns to Look For

#### Pattern 1: High Correlation with Existing Customers

**What it means**: The RSM's engagement activities are most effective with established accounts.

**Action**: Encourage the RSM to maintain this strength while developing strategies for new customers.

#### Pattern 2: Strong Correlation with One-Timers but Low Retention Rate

**What it means**: The RSM is effective at converting initial sales through engagement but struggles with customer retention.

**Action**: Implement post-sale follow-up protocols and relationship-building training.

#### Pattern 3: Low Correlation Across All Segments

**What it means**: The RSM's calls and meetings aren't effectively driving revenue.

**Action**: Review call/meeting quality and content; consider sales training or different engagement approaches.

#### Pattern 4: High Correlation with Supported Customers, Low with Unsupported

**What it means**: The RSM relies heavily on support resources to drive revenue.

**Action**: Develop the RSM's ability to sell independently or optimize their collaboration with support teams.

### Monthly Trends Tab

This tab helps identify patterns over time:

- **Revenue Trends vs. Engagement Activities**: Look for alignment between peaks in calls/meetings and subsequent revenue increases
- **Customer Segment Performance**: Identify which segments are growing or declining over time
- **Lead Conversion Metrics**: Assess how effectively the RSM converts leads to customers

## Example Analysis

**Scenario**: An RSM shows a strong positive correlation (85%) for Repeat Customers with support, but a weak correlation (25%) for One-Time Customers.

**Interpretation**: This RSM excels at leveraging support resources to generate additional revenue from existing relationships but may need help with initial value demonstration to new customers.

**Recommended Action**: Pair this RSM with another who shows strong correlation with One-Time Customers for knowledge sharing and skill development.

## Getting Started

To begin your analysis:

1. Visit the [RSM Dashboard](/rsm_dashboard) for a high-level overview
2. Select an individual RSM to view their detailed performance
